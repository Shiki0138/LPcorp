2. Use Node.js or Go for rapid development
3. PostgreSQL + Redis for data storage
4. Docker Compose for local development
5. Focus on developer productivity

### For Enterprise Systems
1. Consider microservices for large teams
2. Java Spring Boot or .NET for complex business logic
3. Implement event-driven architecture
4. Use Kubernetes for orchestration
5. Invest in observability and monitoring

### For High-Performance Systems
1. Use Go for optimal performance
2. Implement CQRS for read/write optimization
3. Leverage caching extensively
4. Consider event sourcing for audit requirements
5. Focus on horizontal scalability

## Architecture Decision Framework

### Decision Criteria
1. **Team Size and Expertise**
   - Small teams: Monolith
   - Large teams: Microservices
   - Consider learning curve

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Latency sensitive: Go, Rust
   - Throughput focused: Java, .NET
   - Real-time: Node.js, Go

3. **Scalability Needs**
   - Vertical scaling: Monolith OK
   - Horizontal scaling: Microservices
   - Geographic distribution: Event-driven

4. **Complexity Management**
   - Simple domain: Monolith
   - Complex domain: DDD + Microservices
   - Multiple teams: Bounded contexts

5. **Operational Capabilities**
   - Limited ops: Managed services
   - Strong ops: Self-hosted
   - DevOps culture: GitOps

## Modern Architecture Principles

### 1. API-First Design
- Design APIs before implementation
- Use OpenAPI specifications
- Version APIs properly
- Focus on developer experience

### 2. Security by Design
- Zero trust architecture
- Shift security left
- Automate security scanning
- Implement proper secret management

### 3. Observability
- Metrics, logs, and traces
- Distributed tracing
- Real-time monitoring
- Proactive alerting

### 4. Resilience
- Design for failure
- Implement circuit breakers
- Use retry mechanisms
- Graceful degradation

### 5. Automation
- Infrastructure as Code
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated testing
- GitOps workflows

## Conclusion

Modern enterprise architecture is about finding the right balance between:
- Simplicity and capability
- Speed and reliability
- Cost and value
- Innovation and stability

The key is to:
1. Start simple and evolve
2. Focus on business value
3. Invest in automation
4. Build for change
5. Measure everything

Success comes from choosing patterns and technologies that match your specific context, team capabilities, and business requirements rather than following trends blindly.

## Next Steps

1. Assess current architecture
2. Define target architecture
3. Create migration roadmap
4. Build proof of concepts
5. Train team on new technologies
6. Implement incrementally
7. Measure and iterate
