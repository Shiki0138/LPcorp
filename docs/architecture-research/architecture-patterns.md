# Enterprise Architecture Patterns Research

## 1. Microservices vs Monolith Trade-offs

### Microservices Architecture

**Advantages:**
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different tech stacks
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down entire system
- **Scalability**: Scale individual services based on demand
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently on services

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity**: Distributed system complexity
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication overhead
- **Data Consistency**: Managing distributed transactions
- **Operational Overhead**: Multiple deployments, monitoring, logging
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing is more complex

**When to Use:**
- Large teams (100+ developers)
- Clear service boundaries
- Different scaling requirements per component
- Need for technology diversity
- Rapid feature development

### Monolithic Architecture

**Advantages:**
- **Simplicity**: Single codebase, deployment unit
- **Performance**: No network calls between modules
- **Data Consistency**: ACID transactions are straightforward
- **Easier Testing**: Integration testing is simpler
- **Lower Operational Overhead**: Single deployment, monitoring

**Disadvantages:**
- **Scaling Limitations**: Must scale entire application
- **Technology Lock-in**: Single tech stack for entire app
- **Team Coordination**: Teams step on each other's toes
- **Deployment Risk**: Any change requires full deployment
- **Long-term Maintenance**: Code becomes harder to maintain

**When to Use:**
- Small to medium teams
- Early-stage startups
- Simple domain model
- Uniform scaling requirements
- Limited operational expertise

### Hybrid Approaches

**Modular Monolith:**
- Monolithic deployment with clear module boundaries
- Easier to split into microservices later
- Best of both worlds for medium-sized applications

**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):**
- Coarser-grained than microservices
- Shared governance and standards
- Enterprise service bus for communication

## 2. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

### Core Concepts

**Event Types:**
1. **Domain Events**: Business-meaningful occurrences
2. **Integration Events**: Cross-boundary communication
3. **System Events**: Technical/infrastructure events

**Patterns:**
- **Event Notification**: Simple alerts about state changes
- **Event-Carried State Transfer**: Events contain full state
- **Event Sourcing**: Store all changes as events
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models

### Benefits
- **Loose Coupling**: Services don't know about each other
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous processing
- **Resilience**: Temporal decoupling
- **Audit Trail**: Natural event log
- **Real-time Processing**: React to events as they happen

### Challenges
- **Eventual Consistency**: No immediate consistency
- **Complexity**: Debugging distributed flows
- **Event Schema Evolution**: Handling changes
- **Ordering Guarantees**: Ensuring event order
- **Duplicate Events**: Idempotency requirements

### Implementation Patterns

**Choreography:**
```
Service A → Event → Service B
         ↘        ↗
          Service C
```
- Services react to events independently
- No central orchestrator
- Good for simple workflows

**Orchestration:**
```
Orchestrator → Service A
           ↓
        Service B
           ↓
        Service C
```
- Central coordinator manages workflow
- Better for complex business processes
- Easier to monitor and debug

## 3. CQRS and Event Sourcing

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**Principles:**
- Separate models for reading and writing
- Commands change state
- Queries read state
- Different optimization strategies

**Benefits:**
- **Performance**: Optimize read/write separately
- **Scalability**: Scale read/write independently
- **Security**: Different access patterns
- **Flexibility**: Different models for different needs

**Implementation Approaches:**
1. **Simple CQRS**: Separate methods/classes
2. **CQRS with Separate Models**: Different DTOs
3. **CQRS with Separate Databases**: Read replicas
4. **Full CQRS**: Completely separate services

### Event Sourcing

**Core Concept:**
- Store state as sequence of events
- Current state derived from event replay
- Immutable event log

**Benefits:**
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every change recorded
- **Time Travel**: Reconstruct past states
- **Debugging**: See exactly what happened
- **Event Replay**: Fix bugs retroactively

**Challenges:**
- **Complexity**: Steep learning curve
- **Storage**: Events accumulate over time
- **Schema Evolution**: Handling event changes
- **Performance**: Event replay can be slow

**Best Practices:**
- Use snapshots for performance
- Implement event versioning
- Design for idempotency
- Consider event store solutions

## 4. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

### Strategic Design

**Bounded Contexts:**
- Clear boundaries between domains
- Own ubiquitous language
- Explicit interfaces between contexts

**Context Mapping Patterns:**
1. **Shared Kernel**: Shared code between contexts
2. **Customer/Supplier**: Upstream/downstream relationship
3. **Conformist**: Downstream conforms to upstream
4. **Anti-corruption Layer**: Translation between contexts
5. **Open Host Service**: Well-defined protocol
6. **Published Language**: Common language for integration

### Tactical Design

**Building Blocks:**
1. **Entities**: Objects with identity
2. **Value Objects**: Immutable descriptors
3. **Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries
4. **Domain Services**: Business logic
5. **Repositories**: Persistence abstraction
6. **Domain Events**: Things that happened

**Aggregate Design Rules:**
- Small aggregates preferred
- Reference by ID only
- One transaction per aggregate
- Use domain events for communication

### Implementation Guidelines
- Start with domain modeling
- Use ubiquitous language
- Keep infrastructure separate
- Focus on business logic
- Iterate based on learning

## 5. Hexagonal/Clean Architecture

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

**Core Principles:**
- Domain at the center
- Ports define interfaces
- Adapters implement details
- Dependency inversion

**Structure:**
```
         Adapters (REST, gRPC)
              ↓
         Input Ports
              ↓
        Domain Core
              ↓
        Output Ports
              ↓
     Adapters (DB, External APIs)
```

### Clean Architecture

**Layers (inside-out):**
1. **Entities**: Core business rules
2. **Use Cases**: Application business rules
3. **Interface Adapters**: Controllers, presenters
4. **Frameworks & Drivers**: External details

**Dependency Rule:**
- Dependencies point inward
- Inner layers know nothing of outer
- Abstractions don't depend on details

### Benefits
- **Testability**: Easy to test core logic
- **Flexibility**: Swap implementations
- **Independence**: Framework agnostic
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation

### Implementation Tips
- Start with use cases
- Define clear interfaces
- Keep frameworks at edges
- Use dependency injection
- Focus on business logic

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Template
```markdown
# ADR-001: [Decision Title]

## Status
Accepted/Rejected/Superseded

## Context
What is the issue we're addressing?

## Decision
What have we decided?

## Consequences

```

### Best Practices
- Number sequentially
- Keep immutable
- Link related ADRs
- Review regularly
- Store with code
