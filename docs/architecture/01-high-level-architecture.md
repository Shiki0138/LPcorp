# High-Level System Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document presents the high-level architecture for the enterprise system, designed to meet demanding requirements for scalability, performance, security, and compliance. The architecture follows cloud-native principles with a microservices-based approach, ensuring flexibility and resilience while supporting business objectives of 25% revenue growth and 30% operational cost reduction.

## System Overview

### Architecture Principles

1. **Cloud-Native First**: Designed for distributed cloud environments
2. **API-First Design**: All functionality exposed through well-defined APIs
3. **Security by Design**: Zero-trust architecture with defense-in-depth
4. **Event-Driven**: Loosely coupled services communicating via events
5. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear bounded contexts and service boundaries
6. **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined declaratively

## Scalability Patterns

### Horizontal Scaling Strategy

1. **Service Level**
   - Stateless microservices
   - Kubernetes HPA based on CPU/Memory/Custom metrics
   - Service mesh for load balancing

2. **Data Level**
   - Read replicas for PostgreSQL
   - MongoDB sharding for document storage
   - Redis Cluster for cache distribution

3. **Message Level**
   - Kafka partition scaling
   - Consumer group auto-scaling
   - Topic-based load distribution

### Performance Optimization

| Layer | Optimization | Target |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **CDN** | Global edge caching | <50ms latency globally |
| **API Gateway** | Response caching | <100ms p95 latency |
| **Service Layer** | Connection pooling | <20ms service calls |
| **Database** | Query optimization | <50ms query time |
| **Cache** | Redis clustering | <1ms cache hits |

## Disaster Recovery

### RTO/RPO Targets

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 1 hour
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 15 minutes

### DR Strategy

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Normal Operation"
        Primary[Primary Region Active]
        Secondary[Secondary Region Active]
        DR[DR Region Standby]
    end

    subgraph "Primary Failure"
        SecondaryActive[Secondary Region Active]
        DRActive[DR Region Activated]
        PrimaryDown[Primary Region Down]
    end

    Primary -->|Failure| SecondaryActive
    Secondary -->|Promote| SecondaryActive
    DR -->|Activate| DRActive
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Four Pillars of Observability

1. **Metrics**
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Grafana for visualization
   - Custom business metrics

2. **Logging**
   - Structured logging (JSON)
   - Centralized in ElasticSearch
   - Log correlation IDs

3. **Tracing**
   - Distributed tracing with Jaeger
   - End-to-end request tracking
   - Performance bottleneck identification

4. **Events**
   - Audit events in separate store
   - Security events to SIEM
   - Business events to analytics

## Cost Optimization

### Multi-Cloud Cost Management

1. **Resource Optimization**
   - Spot instances for batch processing
   - Reserved instances for baseline
   - Auto-scaling for demand variance

2. **Data Transfer Optimization**
   - Regional data locality
   - CDN for static content
   - Compression for API responses

3. **Storage Tiering**
   - Hot data in SSD storage
   - Warm data in standard storage
   - Cold data in glacier/archive

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: Microservices Architecture
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Need for independent scaling and deployment
- **Decision**: Adopt microservices with clear bounded contexts
- **Consequences**: Increased operational complexity, better scalability

### ADR-003: Event-Driven Architecture
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Need for loose coupling and real-time processing
- **Decision**: Implement event-driven patterns with Kafka
- **Consequences**: Better scalability, eventual consistency challenges

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve high-level architecture
2. Detail microservices boundaries
3. Define data models and schemas
4. Create API specifications
5. Plan proof-of-concept implementations
6. Establish development environments
