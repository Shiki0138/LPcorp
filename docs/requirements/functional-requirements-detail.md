Authentication:
  Type: OAuth 2.0
  Token: Bearer <token>
  Expiry: 3600 seconds
  Refresh: Supported

Rate Limiting:
  Default: 1000 requests/hour
  Burst: 100 requests/minute
  Headers: X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining

Pagination:
  Style: Cursor-based
  Parameters: limit, cursor
  Max Limit: 100
  Default: 20

Response Format:
  Success:
    {
      "data": {},
      "meta": {
        "timestamp": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "version": "1.0"
      }
    }
  
  Error:
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "ERROR_CODE",
        "message": "Human readable message",
        "details": {}
      }
    }
```

### IS2: Event Schema

```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "eventType": "order.created",
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "orderId": "uuid",
    "customerId": "uuid",
    "totalAmount": 99.99,
    "items": [
      {
        "productId": "uuid",
        "quantity": 1,
        "price": 99.99
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "web",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

### IS3: Integration Patterns

#### Synchronous Integration
- **Use Cases**: Real-time data queries, immediate responses
- **Implementation**: REST API, GraphQL
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds maximum
- **Retry Policy**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breaker**: Open after 5 consecutive failures

#### Asynchronous Integration
- **Use Cases**: Batch processing, event notifications
- **Implementation**: Message queues, webhooks
- **Delivery**: At-least-once guarantee
- **Dead Letter Queue**: After 5 failed attempts
- **Message Retention**: 7 days

#### Batch Integration
- **Use Cases**: Data synchronization, bulk updates
- **Implementation**: SFTP, S3 bucket drops
- **Schedule**: Configurable (hourly, daily, weekly)
- **File Formats**: CSV, JSON, XML
- **Validation**: Schema validation before processing

## Acceptance Test Scenarios

### ATS1: User Registration
```gherkin
Feature: User Registration
  As a new user
  I want to register for an account
  So that I can access the system

  Scenario: Successful registration
    Given I am on the registration page
    When I enter valid registration details
    And I click submit
    Then I should receive a verification email
    And I should see a success message
    
  Scenario: Duplicate email registration
    Given I am on the registration page
    When I enter an email that already exists
    And I click submit
    Then I should see an error message
    And the email field should be highlighted
```

### ATS2: Order Processing
```gherkin
Feature: Order Processing
  As a customer
  I want to place an order
  So that I can purchase products

  Scenario: Successful order placement
    Given I have items in my cart
    When I proceed to checkout
    And I enter valid payment information
    Then the order should be created
    And I should receive a confirmation email
    
  Scenario: Out of stock handling
    Given I have an out-of-stock item in cart
    When I proceed to checkout
    Then I should see a stock warning
    And be given options to proceed
