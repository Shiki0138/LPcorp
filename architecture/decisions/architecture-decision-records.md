- Multi-tier caching (L1: in-memory, L2: Redis, L3: CDN)
- Persistence enabled for durability

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Proven reliability and ACID compliance
- Excellent performance with proper indexing
- Strong ecosystem and tooling support
- Natural fit for complex queries and analytics

**Negative:**
- Higher operational complexity with two systems
- Additional cost for Redis infrastructure
- Potential cache coherency challenges

**Mitigations:**
- Automated cache invalidation strategies
